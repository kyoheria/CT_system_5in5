          <h1>What is 5 in 5</h1>
          <p>5 in 5 is an assignmet that was assigned in CT Lab: System to make a daily sketch that shows some kind of intraction with a a small set of constraints to guide the conceptualizaon of daily sketches.</p>
          <p> "Sketches are artisticc expressions not intended as finished works. Sketching serves many purposes and a practice of frequent sketching is extremely valuable to arsts and designers." - from Assignmet sheet</p>
          <p> we started  this process by makeing a mind map of what we like and what we are interested in and I came up with a topic of </p>
          <h2>creating a space</h2>
          <p>and for the constraints, I desided to</p>
          <p>One sketch a day for a 5 days</p>
          <p>Choose two key word from the mind map we made in the class.</p>
          <p>Make a new mind map with those keyword or idea that came across by choosing those keywords</p>
          <p>Make some kind of sketch that shows a interaction</p>
          <p>Make a moodboard to communicate idea more clearly</p>

	      	<h2>Music video + Japanese Idol</h2>
	      	<p>When I choose these two words one song came up in mind by Fudanjyuku, Japanese cross-dressing female idol group, that they havn't made a music video yet so I decided to make a music video setting</p>
	      	<p>So I started with a mind map for the song called "Welcom to My Familiar"</p>
	      	<img src="image_and_videos/day_one_mindmap.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333">
	      	<p>decided that I want to mix match the old Japanese building with warehouse look that is fablicated on the flats that can be move to be able to play with the width of the street or creating a space that will be more open so they may be able to dance. And to show how space ca be created with just three flats as well I made the video below.</p>

          <p>than I made a mood board to communicate the texture and color. I was thinking the conbination of old Japanese street and the wearhouse look</p>

      		<h2>Me + Instaration Art</h2>
      		<p>for this one I decided that two words together would mean instaration about my self and started to make a mind map around that</p>
      		<img src="image_and_videos/day_two_mindmap.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500">
      		<p>I just end up writing down all the things I love, so I thought it might make ence to make instaration of my room with objects that means something to me. *some sketch are done in the same paper</p>
      		<p>I thought it would be interesting to have a recorded voice play when object is picked. So to that, I recorded video of me picking object up in the room and telling the story behind that object.</p>

        <p>since my room was mess and wanted to show somethings in particulerly has influence in my life. I pulled up photos to make a mooodboard </p>

      		<h2>musical + stage</h2>
      		<p>when I choose these keyword, I wanted to make a musical stage that hasn't been on actual stage so I chose to make a stage for "The Greatest Showman" and I made a mindmap around that</p>
      		<img src="image_and_videos/day_three_mindmap.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500">
      		<p>So I did included so many aspect of the stage intraction so to show that I made a video again, to show that how with few flats it is possible to change a same pace to look small or big and able to give a different feeling to the stage</p>

          <p>for the moodboard, I picked a photos I was looking at when I was comming up with the props I used in the video</p>

      		<h2>Sleep + Crafting</h2>
          <p>for the day four, I wanted to do something little bit different from the other days, so I picked two keyword which wouldn't go together so much which were "seelp" and "crafting"</p>
      		<img src="image_and_videos/day_four_mindmap.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500">
          <p>for this day idea didn't came up quickly so I wrote both words in the note book, were only be able to write few words. So I decided to drew a connection between thoes. At the end I knew I wanted to do something dreamy and unrealistic with a crafting skill I already know.</p>
          <p>So I thought making an experience that is normaly more detailed and somewhat titidouse into comething immersive and in total different scale. to show my idea I decided to take a photos of me beading than added stick figure to show the scale I was thinking and the movement I was thinking about</p>
      		<img src="image_and_videos/day_four_image.gif" alt="Trulli" width="500">
          <p>for the moodboard I wanted to communicate more on the that dreamy side of this idea so I pulled up photos of beaded clothe that was photographed in very closedd up vision</p>

      		<h2>Immersive + Calligraphy</h2>
          <p>This day I wanted to do something similar to the day 4 so I took calligraphy and the immersive. I feel like calligraphy is something that is also done in the very smaller scale and in the crasic ways. I thought doing calligraphy with whole body might be fun.</p>
      		<img src="image_and_videos/day_five_midmap.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500">
          <p>so to show the intraction I screen recorded a calligraphy that was done on iPad but it didn't saw what I wanted to do...</p>

          <p>so I tryed actually writing with my feet on my tiny ipad and I could even able to write letter but this shows more on how people would be intracting with it.</p>
